# OZ Map Toolbox

The Snohomish County Planning and Development Services (PDS) GIS team uses this tool to update OZ Maps. OZ Maps are a series of detailed maps that depict zoning, ownership, and cadastral information. The **OZ Map Toolbox** is an ESRI Python Toolbox which automates the refresh of the OZMap map series and exports the maps in the series into PDF files.
